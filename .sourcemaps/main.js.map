He said: you have spoken rightly, and we were amazed at him, asking him and saying that he had spoken rightly. He said: then tell me about ihman. He siad it is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the last day, and to believe in divine destiny (preordainment), both the good and the evil thereof.

He said, Inform me about the Hour.He (the Messenger of Allah) said, About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner. So he said, Well, inform me about the signs thereof. He said, They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings.Thereupon the man went off. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, O Umar, do you know who that questioner was? I replied, Allah and His Messengerknow better. He said, That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel).

By Allah, other than Whom there is no deity, verily one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him, and so he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and thus enters it; and verily one of you performs the actions of the people of the Hellfire, until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has been written overtakes him and so he acts with the actions of the people of Paradise and thus he enters it \"},\n    {id: 5, name: \"Hadith 5\", note: \"Remove the innovation\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of the mother of the faithful, 'Aisha (R.A), who said: The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: He who innovates something in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not of it will have it rejected [by Allah].\"},\n    {id: 6, name:  \"Hadith 6\", note: \"Lawful and unlawful things are cleared\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu 'Abdullah al-Nu'man bin Bashir (R.A) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah(S.A.W) say: The halal is clear and the haram is clear, and between them are matters unclear that are unknown to most people. Whoever is wary of these unclear matters has absolved his religion and honor. And whoever indulges in them has indulged in the haram. It is like a shepherd who herds his sheep too close to preserved sanctuary, and they will eventually graze in it. Every king has a sanctuary, and the sanctuary of Allah is what He has made haram. There lies within the body a piece of flesh. If it is sound, the whole body is sound; and if it is corrupted, the whole body is corrupted.

Eat of the tayyibat (good things), and perform righteous deeds [23:51] and the Almighty has said: O you who believe! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you [2:172]. Then he (peace be upon him) mentioned a man who, having journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty, and who spreads out his hands to the sky saying, O Lord!

Alhamdulillah (praise be to Allah) fills the scales, and subhan-Allah (how far from imperfection is Allah) and Alhamdulillah (praise be to Allah) fill that which is between heaven and earth. And the Salah (prayer) is a light, and charity is a proof, and patience is illumination, and the Qur'an is a proof either for you or against you. Every person starts his day as a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin.\"},\n    {id: 24, name: \"Hadith 24\", note: \"Forbidding of oppression\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari, of the Prophet (S.A.W) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord is that He said: O My servants! I have forbidden oppression for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except those whom I have guided, so seek guidance from Me and I shall guide you. O My servants, all of you are hungry except those whom I have fed, so seek food from Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except those whom I have clothed, so seek clothing from Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sommit sins by day and by night, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness from Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all as pious as the most pious heart of any individual amongst you, then this would not increase My Kingdom an iota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all as wicked as the most wicked heart of any individual amongst you, then this would not decrease My Kingdom an iota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all to stand together in one place and ask of Me, and I were to give everyone what he requested, then that would not decrease what I Possess, except what is decreased of the ocean when a needle is dipped into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I account for you, and then recompense you for. So he who finds good, let him praise Allah, and he who finds other than that, let him blame no one but himself.\"},\n    {id: 25, name: \"Hadith 25\", note: \"All actiion of a believers are charity\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu Dharr (R.A): Some people from amongst the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said to the Prophet (S.A.W), 'O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the rewards; they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give [much] in charity by virtue of their wealth.' He (S.A.W) said, 'Has not Allah made things for you to give in charity? Truly every tasbeehah [saying subhan-Allah] is a charity, and every takbeerah [saying Allahu akbar] is a charity, and every tahmeedah [saying alhamdulillah] is a charity, and every tahleelah [saying la ilaha illAllah] is a charity. And commanding the good is a charity, and forbidding an evil is a charity, and in the sexual act of each one of you there is a charity.' They said, 'O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfills his sexual desire, will he have some reward for that?' He (S.A.W) said: 'Do you not see that if he were to act upon it [his desire] in an unlawful manner, then he would be deserving of punishment? Likewise, if he were to act upon it in a lawful manner, then he will be deserving of a reward.\"},\n    {id: 26, name: \"Hadith 26\", note: \"Minor act are valuable\", explanation: \"\tAbu Hurairah (R.A) reported that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, Every joint of a person must perform a charity each day that the sun rises: to judge justly between two people is a charity. To help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it, is a charity. And the good word is a charity. And every step that you take towards the prayer is a charity, and removing a harmful object from the road is a charity.\"},\n    {id: 27, name: \"Hadith 27\", note: \"Definition of righteousness\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of an-Nawas bin Sam'an (R.A), the Prophet (S.A.W) said: Righteousness is in good character, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your soul, and which you dislike people finding out about.

He (S.A.W) said, 'Consult your heart. Righteousness is that about which the soul feels at ease and the heart feels tranquil.

We said, O Messenger of Allah, it is as if this were a farewell sermon, so advise us. He said, I enjoin you to have Taqwa of Allah and that you listen and obey, even if a slave is made a ruler over you. He among you who lives long enough will see many differences. So for you is to observe my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-principled and rightly-guided successors, holding on to them with your molar teeth. Beware of newly-introduced matters, for every innovation (bid'ah) is an error.\"},\n    {id: 29, name: \"Hadith 29\", note: \"What deed admit you in paradise\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Muadh bin Jabal (R.A) who said: I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from the Hellfire.'

Worship Allah without associating any partners with Him; establish the prayer; pay the Zakah; fast in Ramadan; and make the pilgrimage to the House.Then he (S.A.W) said, 'Shall I not guide you towards the means of goodness? Fasting is a shield, charity wipes away sin as water extinguishes fire, and the praying of a man in the depths of the night.' Then he (S.A.W) recited: '[Those] who forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allah's cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do' [as-Sajdah, 16-17]. Then he (S.A.W) said, 'Shall I not inform you of the head of the matter, its pillar and its peak?' I said, 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He (S.A.W) said, 'The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the prayer and its peak is jihad.' Then he (S.A.W) said, 'Shall I not tell you of the foundation of all of that?' I said, 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' So he took hold of his tongue and said, 'Restrain this.' I said, 'O Prophet of Allah, will we be taken to account for what we say with it?' He (S.A.W) said, 'May your mother be bereaved of you, O Muadh! Is there anything that throws people into the Hellfire upon their faces, or on their noses, except the harvests of their tongues?\"},\n    {id: 30, name: \"Hadith 30\", note: \"The limits set by Allah\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Jurthum bin Nashir (R.A) that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: Verily Allah the Almighty has laid down religious obligations (fara'id), so do not neglect them.

So he (S.A.W) said, Renounce the world and Allah will love you, and renounce what people possess and the people will love you\"},\n    {id: 32, name: \"Hadith 32\", note: \"Neither harming nor reciprocating harm\", explanation: \"\tIt was related on the authority of Abu Sa'id Sa'd bin Malik bin Sinan al-Khudri (R.A) that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.\"},\n    {id: 33, name: \"Hadith 33\", note: \"Proof on claimant and oat upon denial\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Ibn Abbas (R.A), that the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said: Were people to be given everything that they claimed, men would [unjustly] claim the wealth and lives of [other] people. But, the onus of proof is upon the claimant, and the taking of an oath is upon him who denies.\"},\n    {id: 34, name: \"Hadith 34\", note: \"Forbiddeng the evil is part of iman\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree (R.A) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) say, “Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then [let him change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart — and that is the weakest of faith.\tOn the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree (R.A) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) say, “Whosoever of you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then [let him change it] with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart — and that is the weakest of faith.\"},\n    {id: 35, name: \"Hadith 35\", note: \"Islamic brotherhood\", explanation: \" On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (R.A) who said: The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, “Do not envy one another, and do not inflate prices for one another, and do not hate one another, and do not turn away from one another, and do not undercut one another in trade, but [rather] be slaves of Allah and brothers [amongst yourselves]. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he does not oppress him, nor does he fail him, nor does he lie to him, nor does he hold him in contempt. Taqwa (piety) is right here [and he pointed to his chest three times]. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim is inviolable for another Muslim: his blood, his property, and his honour.\"},\n    {id: 36, name: \"Hadith 36\", note: \"Allah help those who help others\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu Hurayrah (R.A), that the Prophet (S.A.W) said: Whoever removes a worldly grief from a believer, Allah will remove from him one of the griefs of the Day of Resurrection.

Whoever shields [or hides the misdeeds of] a Muslim, Allah will shield him in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah will aid His slave so long as he aids his brother. And whoever follows a path to seek knowledge therein, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise. No people gather together in one of the Houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, except that sakeenah (tranquility) descends upon them, and mercy envelops them, and the angels surround them, and Allah mentions them amongst those who are with Him. And whoever is slowed down by his actions, will not be hastened forward by his lineage.\"},\n    {id: 37, name: \"Hadith 37\", note: \"The compensation of Allah upon his slaves\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Ibn Abbas (R.A), from the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W), from what he has related from his Lord: Verily Allah ta’ala has written down the good deeds and the evil deeds, and then explained it [by saying]: Whosoever intended to perform a good deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down with Himself as a complete good deed. And if he intended to perform it and then did perform it, then Allah writes it down with Himself as from ten good deeds up to seven hundred times, up to many times multiplied. And if he intended to perform an evil deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down with Himself as a complete good deed. And if he intended it [i.e., the evil deed] and then performed it, then Allah writes it down as one evil deed.\"},\n    {id: 38, name: \"Hadith 38\", note: \"Approach Allah wuth Nawafil\", explanation: \"\tOn the authority of Abu Hurayrah (R.A) who said: The Messenger of Allah (S.A.W) said, Verily Allah ta’ala has said: Whosoever shows enmity to a wali (friend) of Mine, then I have declared war against him. And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with nafil (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks.
